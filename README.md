# Zeplin Color Picker üé®

[Zeplin](https://zeplin.io)'s macOS color picker that lets you select colors from the project you have open in Zeplin. Installing Zeplin's macOS app automatically installs this color picker as well.

## Installation

Building the Xcode project produces a bundle called `ZeplinColorPicker.colorPicker`. Copying this bundle to the `~/Library/ColorPickers/` directory installs it systemwide.

## Handy tips

### Automate installation

You can install the picker systemwide automatically by adding a run script to the project:

```sh
rm -rf ~/Library/ColorPickers/ZeplinColorPicker.colorPicker
cp -R $BUILD_DIR/Debug/ZeplinColorPicker.colorPicker ~/Library/ColorPickers/ZeplinColorPicker.colorPicker
```

### Simplify testing locally

To simplify testing the picker, you can create an application using the Script Editor:

- Launch `Script Editor.app` and create a document.
- Paste the following AppleScript code:

```applescript
choose color
```

- Save the document in ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù format.

Furthermore, you can launch this application automatically by adding a run script to the project:

```sh
kill `pgrep applet`
open APPLICATION_PATH
```

### Uninstall

To uninstall the color picker entirely, you can remove the `ZeplinColorPicker.colorPicker` bundle within the `~/Library/ColorPickers` directory:

```sh
rm -rf ~/Library/ColorPickers/ZeplinColorPicker.colorPicker
```
